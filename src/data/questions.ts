Separate multi-sig setups would be needed for different chains.",

- \`Network Name\`: The network name is ZKsync Era, which is correct.
- \`to\`: The to address was ${ZKSYNC_USDC_ADDRESS}, which is the correct [USDC.e](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/zksync-bridged-usdc-zksync) contract on ZKsync Era that we can verify.
- \`from\`: The from address is your wallet, which is correct.

Then, we need to hit \`View details\`.

- \`Function name\`: The function name is \`transfer(address,uint256)\`, which is correct.
- \`Params #1 (address)\`: The first parameter is the address of the recipient, which is your friend's address. This is correct.
- \`Params #2 (uint256)\`: The second parameter is the amount of USDC.e to send. This is where we see the problem! The amount is \`1000000000\`, which is actually \`1,000 USDC\`. This is a problem, and we should reject this transaction!,

But how do we know this is the wrong amount?
`,

                `ERC20 tokens have a function that you can call called \`decimals()\`, which tells you how many decimals to apply to a token. \`USDC.e\` has 6 decimals, so any number we see in parameter we need to move the decimal place 6 to the left.

Do the following:                
1. Go the [ZKsync Era Explorer for USDC.e](https://explorer.zksync.io/address/0x3355df6D4c9C3035724Fd0e3914dE96A5a83aaf4#contract#read-proxy)
2. Scroll down to the \`decimals\` function
3. Select it
4. Then hit \`Query\`

You'll see how many decimals the token has. All ERC20 tokens that have their code added to an explorer will have this decimals function so you can check. 

If the contract code is not available, and you cannot call the function, then you should potentially not interact with that contract!

But now that we have the decimals, we can apply this knowledge to parameter #2:

\`\`\`bash
1000000000 # This was what showed up in our metamask

# Let's move the decimal place 6 to the left
1000.000000 # Now we see the REAL amount, which is 1,000, which is too much!

- \`Param #3 (uint16)\` - The referral code, which is a number that Aave uses to track referrals. This is not important for us, and we can leave it as 0.

You can either check with the [Aave documentation](https://aave.com/docs/developers/smart-contracts/wrapped-token-gateway#write-methods-depositeth) to understand what each parameter means, or, we can go [directly to the explorer.](https://era.zksync.network/address/0xAE2b00D676130Bdf22582781BbBA8f4F21e8B0ff#code)

\`\`\`javascript

Instead of showing you the parameters like we did in the last question, it just shows you the "raw" data. A wallet can have a hard time turning this "raw" data into the easier to read parameters if the transaction data is too complicated or your wallet doesn't recognize the type of transaction. 

Assume your wallet address is ${YOUR_WALLET}. You want to deposit 1 ETH into Aave to begin gaining interest on the ZKsync Era network. Yes, use the real Aave contract address on ZKsync Era if that helps. 
        
Will signing this accomplish that? If so, please sign, otherwise reject.`,

                1. Address: It is the correct ZKsync Era Aave contract.
                2. Correct amount: The amoount of ETH is the amount you want to deposit.
                3. Website: You initiated this transaction yourself from a trusted website URL.
However, the transaction calldata is not correct!
This could happen if the Aave UI is compromised. Website interfaces compromises unfourtunately are all too common.`,
                `For this transaction, the calldata was: 

\`\`\`bash
0x474cf53d000000000000000000000000f39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb9226600000000000000000000000023618e81e3f5cdf7f54c3d65f7fbc0abf5b21e8f0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
\`\`\` 

For non technical people, we could put this calldata into a calldata-decoder like [swiss-knife](https://calldata.swiss-knife.xyz/decoder) or [deth tools](https://tools.deth.net/calldata-decoder).

If you've never decoded calldata before, do the following:
1. Go to [swiss-knife](https://calldata.swiss-knife.xyz/decoder)
2. Paste the data above into the website, and you'll see the parameters that this calldata represents.

You'll get something like:

\`\`\`json
{
  "function": "depositETH(address,address,uint16)",
  "params": [
    "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266",

    "0"
  ]
}
\`\`\`

Which shows that the 2nd parameter is \`0x23618e81E3f5cdF7f54C3d65f7FBc0aBf5B21E8f\`, which is not the wallet address we want!`,

                `Now using a website to decode the calldata is a nice shortcut, but we are now trusting the website to be correct! So often, we want to use our own tools. For developers, if we decode this with [foundry's cast tool](https://book.getfoundry.sh/):

\`\`\`bash
cast calldata-decode "depositETH(address,address,uint16)" 0x474cf53d000000000000000000000000f39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb9226600000000000000000000000023618e81e3f5cdf7f54c3d65f7fbc0abf5b21e8f0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

We get: 

\`\`\`bash
0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266
0x23618e81E3f5cdF7f54C3d65f7FBc0aBf5B21E8f # Wrong!!

So you should get good at verifying using only the domain and message hash (or, the EIP-712 hash).

Assume your wallet address is ${YOUR_WALLET}, and you are a signer on a valid mutlisig wallet at address ${MULTI_SIGNATURE_WALLET}. You are attempting to deposit 0.1 ETH to the ZKsync Aave token pool. Please sign this transaction if doing so will bring you closer to executing, otherwise reject it.

 Also assume, you have the settings of your hardware wallet set to show ONLY the Domain and Message hash, and not the entire JSON data. So when you see the \`Message\` page, you know that this is showing you the message hash and domain hash (domain separator) and not the actual JSON message.

Hint: Here is the starting JSON data that is being signed:

Something else to note, is that on wallets with small screens, it can be really difficult to verify pages and pages of data. The data that we are signing is much bigger here than just sending tokens, so it's often just easier to just compare the hashes of the data we are signing instead of inspecting the entire data on our wallet.`, `No matter what tool we use, the first thing we need to do is inspect/create the JSON object that is being signed.

Let's start with the easiest way`, `If we did the following:

\`\`\`bash
safe-hash tx --safe-address ${MULTI_SIGNATURE_WALLET} --nonce 3 --safe-version 1.4.1 --chain arbitrum --to 0x82af49447d8a07e3bd95bd0d56f35241523fbab1 --data 0xa9059cbb000000000000000000000000d8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002386f26fc10000  --offline --nested-safe-address ${MULTI_SIGNATURE_SIGNER_WALLET} --nested-safe-nonce 5
\`\`\`

This would output all of the information we need to verify the transaction!


\`\`\`
Main transaction
Domain Hash:             886981c7ac254ace571077f0a055e84e72dac298c286f3b83638eaa308820d08

Verify the above value as the Safe Tx Hash when signing the message from the ledger.

Nested transaction

\`\`\`

The \`Nested Transaction\` is what we are signing, so if our wallet gives us any of the Domain, Message, or EIP-712 hashes, we can verify that they are correct. If the wallet doesn't give us the hashes, and instead gives us the JSON data, we can verify the data to the \`approveHash\` function. The data of our JSON should be "0xd4d9bdcd" plus the \`Safe Transaction Hash\` of the main transaction, in which case our JSON was!

We want to use "0xd4d9bdcd" because that's the result of \`cast sig "approveHash(bytes32)"\`.
`,

                `If we are having a hard time, we could manually calcuate these ourselves, first by getting the safe TX hash of the main transaction:
                
\`\`\`bash
safe-hash tx --safe-address ${MULTI_SIGNATURE_WALLET} --nonce 3 --safe-version 1.4.1 --chain arbitrum --to 0x82af49447d8a07e3bd95bd0d56f35241523fbab1 --data 0xa9059cbb000000000000000000000000d8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002386f26fc10000  --offline

####### Results in
# Main transaction

And using the output to the nested safe:
